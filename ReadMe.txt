Capstone Project 2

Image classification of poisonous plants using Convolutional Neural Network.

The goal will be for the network to be able to identify poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak.

The use cases will be for National Parks to eventually have an app that will allow park goers to idetify poisonous plants both
for their safety and knowledge.  This could be the start of a suite of features used by campers and outdoors adventurers.  In the
future, add image recognition of things like poisonous mushrooms as well.

So far the project has tested two CCN architectures, AlexNet and LeNet.
